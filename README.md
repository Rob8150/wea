# Weather Utilities in Go 1.19+
ðŸš§ *under construction* ðŸš§


## Weather Functions

* **Dew Point, Absolute Humidity, Relative Humidity, Vapour Pressure**

* **Weather functions Copyright 2022 Robert Clark under Open Source Apache2.**


### Work in Progress
* **99 % Complete**

##### **Inputs Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure all unints in SI**

* **Absolute Humidity**

Absolute humidity is the total amount of water vapor contained in a given volume of dry air. 
Water vapor is measured in units of weight (grams) and dry air in units of volume called cubic meters

* **Specific Humidity**

Specific humidity is the total amount of water vapor contained in a given volume of dry air. 
Water vapor is measured in units of volume (ml) and dry air in units of volume called cubic meters


* **Vapor Pressure**

Vapor pressure (or vapour pressure in English-speaking countries other than the US; see spelling differences)
or equilibrium vapor pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium
with its condensed phases (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a closed system.The equilibrium
vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate.
